This project, part of the Womanium Quantum+AI 2024 program in collaboration with Fraunhofer ITWM, focuses on applying quantum machine learning techniques to conspicuity detection in production processes.

### Goals

1. Familiarization with Pennylane
2. Implementing basic quantum machine learning workflows
3. Developing a custom quantum model for function approximation (sine function)
4. Applying quantum machine learning to an industrial dataset for defect detection
